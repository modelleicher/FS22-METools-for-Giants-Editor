# FS22-METools-for-Giants-Editor

This is a Collection of Tools (Scripts) for Giants Editor I wrote over time. There are scripts useful for mapping but also Scripts useful for vehicle integration.
The Collection will be updated and added onto over time, also Scripts might be changed or improved upon. If you are looking for an older Version of a particular Script you can use the Commits to find an older one.
Initial Release on Github is 28.04.2022.

Bugreports and Feedback is welcome in the Issues :)

There are no Tutorials on the Scripts as of right now (altough I showed some of them in use on my Lets Map Series on Youtube (German) but there is a short description on How to use in the header of each script!
